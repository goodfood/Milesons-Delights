Press seams to seal on other short rectangle of dough. Cut into 4 (2-inch-wide) strips. 
Press strips around edges of pan, pinching seams to seal between bottom dough and side dough.

3Meanwhile, in large bowl, beat cream cheese, 1/2 teaspoon lime peel and the salt with whisk until well combined. 
Beat in condensed milk, lime juice and egg yolk with whisk until smooth. 
4Pour into partially baked crust in pan. 
Bake 18 to 20 minutes longer or until crust is light golden brown and bars begin to pull away from sides of pan. 
Cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Cover pan with foil; refrigerate 3 hours. 
5To cut bars, lift foil to remove bars from pan; place on cutting board. Cut into 3 rows by 3 rows.
