Meringue Cookies

4 large egg white(s) 

1/2 tsp distilled white vinegar, or cider vinegar 

1 cup(s) sugar 

2 tsp vanilla extract 

2 Tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder, powder  or 1 cup mini chocolate chips

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 200ºF. Line 2 baking sheets with foil.
In a large bowl, beat egg whites with an electric mixer until frothy. 
Add vinegar; beat until soft peaks form. 
Increase speed to high and gradually add sugar; beat until glossy stiff peaks form. Beat in vanilla.
Remove half of meringue to another bowl; stir in cocoa until blended. 
If desired you may omit cocoa and add 1 cup of mini Chocolate Chips.
Spoon tablespoons of both meringues onto prepared baking sheets about 1 inch apart each, 
making about 44 cookies – half vanilla-flavored and half cocoa-flavored. 
Or you can make marbleized cookies by spooning 1/2 tablespoon of each type of meringue into a mound and 
then swirling the 2 together with your fingers.
Bake until meringues feel dry and crisp all the way through, about 3 hours. 
Turn off oven; leave meringues in oven for 1 hour. 
Transfer baking sheets to wire racks to cool completely. 
Peel meringues off foil and store in an airtight container. Yields about 2 cookies per serving.
