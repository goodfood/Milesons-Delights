- 5 large egg white
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ tsp almond extract
- 1/8 tsp salt 
Directions:
Preheat oven to 225°F. Cover 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
Combine 1 egg white, 1/4 cup of cocoa, 2 tablespoons of sugar and both flavors of extract in a large bowl. Beat the remaining 4 egg whites and salt with an electric mixer just until soft peaks form; add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, while beating, until the egg whites are stiff and glossy. Fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture in three batches. Fill a pastry bag with the mixture and pipe out the cookies onto the cookie sheets. Each cookie should be about 1-inch wide. Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes until a dried texture. Let cool completely on wire racks before removing from parchment paper.
